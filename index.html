      <p>Envisioned as the first in a series of interventions that engage monuments in the United States and beyond, Brendan Fernandes’ <i>New Monuments</i> | <i>Chicago</i> (April 10–13, 2024) was a temporary, site-specific installation at the General John Alexander Logan Monument in Chicago’s Grant Park.</p>
      <p>Presented by Black Cube Nomadic Art Museum in association with the Chicago Park District, <i>New Monuments</i> | <i>Chicago</i>  comprised a large-scale sculptural installation designed in collaboration with AIM Architecture; a durational evening performance; and an interactive community prompt through which Fernandes posed a question to passersby: “How can we become the monument?”</p>
      <p>This last component—the community prompt—is the focus of this page, which archives the public’s responses to Fernandes’ inquiry.</p>

    <p>Answers were collected both virtually and in-person via drop boxes located throughout the city, in a bid to assemble a diverse array of perspectives. Respondents wrote and/or drew their ideas on silver, foil-stamped ribbon tags. These tags were additively displayed in Black Cube’s on-site shipping container throughout the duration of the installation, and now live on below.</p>
    <p>We invite you to read what people had to say, and to reflect for yourself. We know that monuments and their role in public space have been, still are, and will continue to be at the heart of discussions heated, complex, and tangled. We welcome and appreciate your curiosity.</p>

      <p>Land Acknowledgement (adapted from The Art Institute of Chicago): <i>New Monuments</i> | <i>Chicago</i> was located on the traditional unceded homelands of the Council of the Three Fires: the Ojibwe, Odawa, and Potawatomi Nations. Many other tribes, such as the Miami, Ho-Chunk, Menominee, and Sac and Fox, also called this area home. The region has long been a center for Indigenous people to gather, trade, and maintain kinship ties. Today, one of the largest urban American Indian communities in the United States resides in Chicago. Members of this community continue to contribute to the life of this city and to celebrate their heritage, practice traditions, and care for the land and waterways.</p>
